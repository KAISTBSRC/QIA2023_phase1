# Basemodel - Phase 1

This basemodel code consist 3 steps.

1) dataset preprocessing using pretrained BERT - See embed.ipynb
2) Training model - See train.ipynb
3) Model Test - See test.ipynb



Basemodel result can see [QIA-Hackathon2023 | Kaggle | Leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/qia-hackathon2023/leaderboard)


 I think result is not good because I do not use Question information.

This code is just basemodel, So It is not correct.


```
In my opinion, I think Phase 1 is not good task Because It is hard to recognition personality only 1 sentence. 

So in phase 2, We will give other task that is not same as phase 1 task maybe.
```
